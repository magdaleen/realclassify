- finish the proof that \nf_\R(f) = +- \nf_\C(f) in modality 1, including
  restrictions
- check computing time for \mu (see trac ticket #375)
- get rid of classify.lib (use Milnorcode?)
- treat the remaining cases
- give transformations
- read through the code
- write paper
- check if LIBs are needed
- add references to library
- check assumptions
- test realclassify.lib (by randomly generated examples)
- collect feedback (Gerhard, GM, Wolfram)
- get rid of scalings, if possible
- check constant factors when using factorize
- update the Singular test file

- use Ignacio's theorem to solve the problem with factorization over the reals
- write down theorems and algorithms in latex
- set up git repositories

for each case (A_k, D_k, E_{6,7,8}, E_{12,13,14}, Z, W, P_8, X_9, J_10, ...):
- draw the diagram
- write down the algorithm
- write down the theory behind it
- implement the case in realclassify.lib, including subprocedures
