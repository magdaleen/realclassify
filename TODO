mathematical issues:
- finish the proof that \nf_\R(f) = +- \nf_\C(f) in modality 1, including
  restrictions
- use Ignacio's theorem to solve the problem with factorization over the reals

for writing the paper:
- write down theorems and algorithms in latex

next cases to tackle:
- J[10]
- J[10+k]
- X[9]
- remaining cases with modality 1

computational issues:
- get rid of scalings, if possible
- check assumptions
- check constant factors when using factorize
- check if highest corner method needs ds
- check computing time for \mu (see trac ticket #375)
- collect feedback (Gerhard, GM, Wolfram)

technical stuff for classify.lib, to be done before release:
- check if LIBs are needed
- add references to library
- read through the code
- update the Singular test file
- test realclassify.lib (by randomly generated examples)

future work:
- get rid of classify.lib (use Milnorcode?)
- give transformations

originally, we planned to,
for each case (A_k, D_k, E_{6,7,8}, E_{12,13,14}, Z, W, P_8, X_9, J_10, ...):
- draw the diagram
- write down the algorithm
- write down the theory behind it
- implement the case in realclassify.lib, including subprocedures
