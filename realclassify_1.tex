\section{Introduction}
The goal of this paper, together with its second part, is to present efficient
algorithms for the classification of isolated hypersurface singularities up to
modality~1 and corank 2 over the real numbers with respect to right
equivalence. We refer to the classification given by V.I.~Arnold in
\cite{AVG1985}. Hence we consider smooth real functions with a critical point
at the origin and critical value $0$, i.e.\@ functions in $\m^2$, where $\m$
denotes the ideal of function germs vanishing at the origin. Two function germs
$f, g \in \m^2 \subset \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$ are considered as right
equivalent, denoted by $f \requiv g$, if there exists an $\R$-algebra
automorphism $\phi$ of $\R[[x_1,\ldots, x_n]]$ such that $\phi(f) = g$.  We
have implemented all the algorithms presented here in the computer algebra
system \Singular.  The implementation is freely available as a \Singular{}
library called \realclassify{} which relies on \Singular's \classify{} to
determine, for a given polynomial, the type in Arnold's classification over the
complex numbers. The methods used in \classify{} will not be discussed in this
paper. For more information in this regard, \cite{Kruger} can be studied.

Using the Splitting Lemma (Theorem~\ref{SplittingLemma}), any function germ $f$
over the real numbers with an isolated singularity at the origin can be
written, after choosing a suitable coordinate system, as the sum of two
functions of which the variables are disjoint. One of the functions, called the
nondegenerate part of $f$, is a nondegenerate quadratic form and the other
function, called the residual part of $f$, is an element of $\m^3$. The number
of variables in the residual part is equal to the corank of $f$, denoted by
$\corank(f)$. In this paper we only consider germs with corank $0$, $1$
and~$2$.  A version of the Splitting Lemma for singularities over $\R$ and a
corresponding algorithm are discussed in section \ref{TheSplittingLemma}.

In \cite{AVG1985} Arnold classified the real singularities of modality $0$ and
$1$ up to stable equivalence into main types which split up into more subtypes
depending the sign of certain terms. Two functions are stably equivalent if
they are right equivalent after the direct addition of nondegenerte quadratic
forms. Hence after applying the Splitting Lemma,  we only need to consider the
residual part in order to complete the classification.   It can be easily seen
that the subtypes are complex equivalent to a complex singularity type of the
same name as its corresponding real main singularity type (see Table
\ref{normal forms}). In fact there is a bijection between the complex
singularity types of modality $0$ and $1$ and the main real singularity types.
Thus, if we can determine the complex singularity type of a function germ, we
only need to determine the correct subtype of the corresponding main real
singularity type.

We denote the $k$-jet of a function germ $f$ by $\jet(f,k)$. In section
\ref{ResultsRegardingTheFactorizationOfHomogeneousPolynomialsOverRAndQ} we
discuss the factorization of the lowest nonzero jets of two right-equivalent
functions. These results are used in sections
\ref{RealSingularitiesOfZeroModality} to \ref{ExceptionalSingularities}, where
the algorithms are given to classify germs in $\m^3$. Firstly, we show that the
$k$-jets of two right-equivalent functions, where $k$ is the order of the
functions, factorize in the same way over $\mathbb R$ (Proposition~\ref{kjet}).
Since
the real numbers are floating numbers in \textsc{Singular}, it is not always
possible to factorize over the real numbers using \textsc{Singular}. In some
cases we prove that these lowest jets will always factorize in linear terms
over the rational numbers and thus in \textsc{Singular}, for example when the
lowest jet is of degree $k$ and has $k$ similar factors (Lemma \ref{x^3}). In
some other cases this unfortunately is not true. Since we can distinguish
between some singularities, by only considering the number of real roots of its
lowest nonzero jet, the similar factorization of the lowest nonzero jets is
still useful in these cases. Because the lowest nonzero jet of a function germ
is a homogeneous polynomial, we use dehomogenization and the library
``rootsur.lib" \cite{roots}, a library counting the real roots of a univariate
polynomial in \textsc{Singular}, to count the roots. We for instance use this
method in the classification of the $D_4$ (Algorithm~\ref{D[4]}) and $E_6$
(Algorithm \ref{E[6]}) cases.

Sometimes other methods are used in addition to the above methods, for example
the normal form of singularities of type $E_{14}$ is determined by
systematically computing higher jets of the $\mathbb R$-algebra automorphism
between the normal form of the function and the function itself considering the
terms of these functions, after the lowest jet is determined using the above
methods (Algorithm \ref{E[14]}).

In the cases $J_{10}$ and $J_{10+k}$, $k>0$ we used different normal forms than
Arnold. These forms are more suitable to work with over the real numbers and
specifically simplify the computations to classify these cases over the real
numbers. We include a list of the normal forms we used at the beginning of
section \ref{TheRealClassificationOfTheResidualPart}.

Lastly, we used the method of blowing up the origin (Algorithm
\ref{BlowingUp}), which simplifies singularities. In the case $Y_{r,s}$,
$r,s>4$ (Algorithm \ref{Y[r,s]}) enough information can be subtracted from the
resulting, simplified, singularity such that the case can be solved, in some
specific cases, unfortunately using approximations.


\section{Prerequisites}

\subsection{The Milnor Number}

We briefly recall the following well-known definition:

\begin{defn}
For $f \in \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$ and $p \in \A_{\R}^n$, the
\emph{Milnor number} of $f$ at $p$ is defined as
\[
\mu(f, p) := \dim_{\R}
\left( \R[[x_1-p_1, \ldots, x_n-p_n]] \bigg/
\left\langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \ldots,
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right\rangle \right)
\in \N \cup \{\infty\} \,.
\]
If $p$ is the origin, we simply write $\mu(f)$ instead of $\mu(f, p)$.
\end{defn}

The Milnor number is known to be finite at isolated singularities
(cf.\@ Lemma~2.3 in \cite{GLS2007}) and to be invariant under right equivalence
(cf.\@ Lemma~2.10 ibid.). It is thus an important tool for the classification
of isolated singularities. We refer to \cite{GLS2007} for more properties of
this invariant.

We use Algorithm~\ref{alg_Milnor} to compute the Milnor number of a given
polynomial at the origin. In line 3, $\dim(\langle G \rangle)$ denotes the
dimension of $\langle G \rangle$ as an ideal, which is easy to read off from
the standard basis $G$. In line 6, $\NF_<$ is any weak normal form w.r.t.\@ the
monomial ordering~$<$. Note that the set $K$ is garantueed to be finite. We
refer to \cite{GP2008} for details on (local) monomial orderings, standard
bases and (weak) normal forms.

\begin{algorithm}[h]

\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\text{ and } m \not\in J = \langle G \rangle \}$
\STATE $L :=$ a basis of the $\R$-vector space $\langle K \rangle_{\R}$
\RETURN $|L|$
\ENDIF

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{The Determinacy}

In general, the singularities we deal with in this paper are defined for power
series, but algorithmically, we want to work with polynomials. It is thus
important for our algorithmic approach that any power series defining an
isolated singularity is right equivalent to a polynomial which can be obtained
from it by leaving out terms of sufficiently high order.

\begin{defn}
Let $f \in \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$ be a power series.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $f = \sum_{j=0}^\infty f_j$ be the decomposition of $f$ into
homogeneous parts $f_j$ of degree $j$.
For $k \in \N$, we define the \emph{$k$-jet} of $f$ as
\[
\jet(f,k) := \sum_{i=0}^k f_k \,.
\]
In other words, the $k$-jet of $f$ can be obtained from $f$ by leaving out all
terms of order higher that $k$.

\item $f$ is called \emph{$k$-determined} if
\[
\forall g \in \m^{k+1}: \quad f \requiv \jet(f,k)+g \,.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

The determinacy is, just as the Milnor number, both invariant under right
equivalence and finite for isolated singularities. We cite the following
statement (cf.\@ \cite{GLS2007}, Supplement to Theorem~2.23) due to its
importance for the algorithmic approach and refer to \cite{GLS2007} for further
results regarding the determinacy:

\begin{prop}
Let $f \in \m \subset \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$. If it holds that
\[
\m^{k+1} \subset \m^2 \left\langle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \ldots,
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right\rangle_{\R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]} \,,
\]
then $f$ is $k$-determined.
\end{prop}

As a direct consequence of this, any power series $f$ which has an isolated
singularity at the origin is $(\mu(f)+1)$-determined. But we can often compute
a much better upper bound for the determinacy by using the above statement as
in Algorithm~\ref{alg_Determinacy}. It is worth to note that
both the Milnor number and the determinacy of an arbitrary power series
$f \in \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$ do not change if we regard $f$ as an element of
$\C[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$. The same holds for the output of the corresponding
algorithms presented here.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{\label{alg_Determinacy} \textsc{Determinacy}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\REQUIRE{$f \in \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ with an isolated singularity at the origin}

\STATE $k := \textsc{Milnor}(f)+1$

\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right) \subset \Q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$

\IF{$(\NF_<(\m^{l+1},G) = 0)$}
\STATE $k := l$
\BREAK
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\RETURN $k$

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Blowing-up}

In algebraic geometry, blowing-up is a well-known method. The purpose of this
section is to give a brief explanation why applying the map
$\varphi: (x,y) \mapsto (x,1)$ to a homogeneous polynomial $f(x,y)$ with an
isolated singularity at the origin corresponds to blowing up the variety $V(f)$
at the origin plus choosing a chart. We will make use of the map $\varphi$ for
the classification of certain singularities, e.g.\@ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:D_4}.

Let us define a variety $\Gamma$ by
\[
\Gamma := \{ ((x,y), [w:z]) \mid xz-yw = 0 \} \subset \R^2 \times \Pj_{\R}^1
\]
and consider the blowing-up map
\begin{align*}
\pi: \quad \Gamma &\rightarrow \R^2 \\
((x,y), [w:z]) &\mapsto (x,y) \,.
\end{align*}
Let $\widetilde{V}$ be the Zariski closure of $\pi^{-1}(V\setminus\{0\})$. We
know that there is a one-to-one correspondence between points in
$\widetilde{V} \setminus (\{0\} \times \Pj_{\R}^1)$ and $V\setminus\{0\}$, the
two objects can thus be identified with each other. We are interested in
$W := \widetilde{V} \cap (\{0\} \times \Pj_{\R}^1)$ which we may think of as a
variety in $\Pj_{\R}^1$ and which corresponds to the tangent cone of $V$ at the
origin. If we choose $w \mapsto [w:1]$ as a chart of $\Pj_{\R}^1$, then all
points in $\Gamma$ must satisfy $x = yw$. Hence $W$ can be described by
$f(yw,y)/y^h = f(w,1)$ where $h$ is the degree of $f$. Replacing $w$ with $x$
finally yields $f(x,1) = \varphi(f(x,y))$.

If we do not want to lose any information about $W$ by choosing the chart as
above, we have to make sure that the point $[1:0]$ does not lie in $W$. This
can always be achieved by applying a coordinate transformation such that the
coefficient of $x^h$ in $f$ is non-zero. Also note that the shape of $W$ is
invariant under coordinate changes of $V$.


\subsection{Results regarding the factorization of homogeneous polynomials
over $\R$ and $\Q$}%
\label{ResultsRegardingTheFactorizationOfHomogeneousPolynomialsOverRAndQ}

\begin{defn}
Let $\phi$ be an $\R$-algebra automorphism of $\R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$.
For $j > 0$ we define the
\emph{$j$-jet} of $\phi$, denoted by $\phi_j$, to be the automorphism given by
\[
\phi_j(x_i) := \jet(\phi(x_i),j) \quad \forall i = 1,\ldots,n \,.
\]
\end{defn}

The next result is in many cases a starting point for the classification of the
residual part, see section~\ref{sec:residual_part}. Given $f$ and $g$ with $f
\requiv g$, it can be used to determine $\phi_1$ for some automorphism $\phi$
such that $\phi(f) = g$.

\begin{prop}\label{kjet}
Let $f,g \in \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$ be two power series with $f \requiv g$ and
$k := \ord(f) > 1$. Let $\phi$ be an $\R$-algebra automorphism of
$\R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$ such that $\phi(f)=g$.

If $\jet(f,k)$ factorizes as
\[
\jet(f,k) = f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t}
\]
in $\R[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$, then $\jet(g,k)$ factorizes as
\[
\jet(g,k) = \phi_1(f_1)^{s_1} \cdots \phi_1(f_t)^{s_t} \,.
\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
By assumption we have that $f = f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t} + f'$, where
$f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t}$ is homogeneous of degree $k$ and the order of $f'$
is greater than $k$. We denote the higher order parts of $\phi$ by
$\phi^* := \phi-\phi_1$. Since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, it follows that
\begin{align*}
\phi(f) &= \phi(f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t}) + \phi(f') \\
&= \phi_1(f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t})
+ \phi^*(f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t}) + \phi(f') \,.
\end{align*}
where $\phi_1(f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t})$ is homogeneous of degree $k$ and
both $\phi^*(f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t})$ and $\phi(f')$ are of order higher
than $k$. Hence
\[
\jet(g, k) = \jet(\phi(f), k) = \phi_1(f_1^{s_1} \cdots f_t^{s_t})
= \phi_1(f_1)^{s_1} \cdots \phi_1(f_t)^{s_t} \,.
\]
\end{proof}

Since we do not want to work with rounding errors nor field extensions in the
implementation of the proposed algorithms, the above result would not be of
much help for this purpose without the following result.

\begin{lemma}\label{x^3}
If $f \in \Q[x,y]$ is homogeneous and factorizes as
\[
\text{(i) } g_1^d \text{ or (ii) } g_1 g_2^d \quad \text{ over } \R \,,
\]
where $g_1, g_2 \in \R[x,y]$ are polynomials of degree $1$ and $d > 1$, then
$f$ factorizes as
\[
\text{(i) } ag_1'^d \text{ or (ii) } ag_1' g_2'^d
\quad \text{ over } \Q \,,
\]
respectively, where $g_1', g_2' \in \Q[x,y]$ are polynomials of degree $1$ and
$a \in \Q$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

(i) Let $f = (a_1x+a_2y)^d$, $a_1, a_2 \in \R$. Without loss of generality,
suppose $a_1 \neq 0$. Then $f = a_1^d(x+\frac{a_2}{a_1}y)^d$. Since the
coefficient of $x^d$ in $f \in \Q[x,y]$ is $a_1^d$, we have $a_1^d \in \Q$ and
therefore $(x+\frac{a_2}{a_1}y)^d \in \Q[x,y]$ which, by dehomogenization,
leads to $(x+\frac{a_2}{a_1})^d \in \Q[x]$. Since $\Q$ is a perfect field it
follows that $\frac{a_2}{a_1} \in \Q$. Thus $f = ag_1'^d$, where
$a := a_1^d \in \Q$ and $g_1' = x+\frac{a_2}{a_1}y \in \Q[x,y]$.

(ii) Let $f = (a_1x+a_2y)(a_3x+a_4y)^d$, $a_1,\ldots,a_4 \in \R$. Suppose
$a_1,a_3 \neq 0$. For the cases $a_1,a_4 \neq 0$, $a_2,a_3 \neq 0$ and
$a_2,a_4 \neq 0$ the proofs are similar. We have $a_1a_3^d \in \Q$ analogously
to part (i). Hence $(x+\frac{a_2}{a_1}y)(x+\frac{a_4}{a_3}y)^d \in \Q[x,y]$
which in turn implies $(x+\frac{a_2}{a_1})(x+\frac{a_4}{a_3})^d \in \Q[x]$.
Since $\Q$ is a perfect field it follows that the roots of this polynomial are
rational. Therefore $f = ag_1'g_2'^d$ with $a: = a_1a_3^d \in \Q$,
$g_1' := (x+\frac{a_2}{a_1}y) \in \Q[x,y]$, and
$g_2' := (x+\frac{a_4}{a_3}y) \in \Q[x,y]$.
\end{proof}


\section{The Splitting Lemma}\label{TheSplittingLemma}

The following well-known theorem, called the Splitting Lemma, allows us to
reduce the classification to germs of full corank or, algorithmically, to
a polynomial contained in $\m^3 \cap \R[x_1,\ldots,x_c]$ for a given input
polynomial of corank $c$. We present a version for singularities over the real
numbers, taking into account the signs of the squares.

\begin{theorem}\label{SplittingLemma}
If $f \in \m^2 \subset \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_n]]$ has an isolated singularity and if
its corank is $c$, then
\[
f \requiv g -\sum_{i=c+1}^{c+\lambda} x_i^2 +\sum_{i=c+\lambda+1}^n x_i^2
\]
with $g \in \m^3 \cap \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_c]]$. $g$ is called the residual part of
$f$ and $\lambda$ is called the inertia index of~$f$. Both $g$ and $\lambda$
are uniquely determined up to right equivalence.
\end{theorem}

The following proof is based upon the proofs of the Theorems 2.46 and 2.47 in
\cite{GLS2007}.

\begin{proof}
The corank of the Hessian matrix of $f$ at $0$ is $c$, so by the theory of
quadratic forms over $\R$ there is a transformation matrix $T$ such that
\[
T^t \cdot H(f)(\mathbf{0}) \cdot T = \diag(0,\ldots,0,-1,\ldots,-1,1,\ldots,1)
\,.
\]
Therefore the linear coordinate change
$(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mapsto (x_1,\ldots,x_n) \cdot T^t$ transforms the 2-jet of
$f$ into
$\left(-\sum_{i=c+1}^{c+\lambda} x_i^2 +\sum_{i=c+\lambda+1}^n x_i^2\right)$
where $\lambda$ is the inertia index of $f$.
Applied to $f$, this transformation leads to
\begin{align*}
f^{(3)} (x_1,\ldots,x_n)
  :\!&= f((x_1,\ldots,x_n) \cdot T^t) \\
  &= g_3
  -\sum_{i=c+1}^{c+\lambda} x_i^2 +\sum_{i=c+\lambda+1}^n x_i^2
  +\sum_{i=c+1}^n x_i\cdot h_i^{(3)}
\end{align*}
with $g_3 \in \m^3 \cap \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_c]]$ and $h_i^{(3)} \in \m^2$. The
coordinate change $\varphi^{(3)}$ defined by
\[
\varphi^{(3)}(x_i) :=
\begin{cases}
x_i, &i \leq c, \\
x_i-\frac{1}{2}h_i^{(3)}, &i > c.
\end{cases}
\]
yields
\begin{align*}
f^{(4)} (x_1,\ldots,x_n)
  :\!&= f^{(3)}(\varphi^{(3)}(x_1,\ldots,x_n)) \\
  &= g_3 +g_4
  -\sum_{i=c+1}^{c+\lambda} x_i^2 +\sum_{i=c+\lambda+1}^n x_i^2
  +\sum_{i=c+1}^n x_i\cdot h_i^{(4)} \,.
\end{align*}
with $g_4 \in \m^4 \cap \R[[x_1,\ldots,x_c]]$ and $h_i^{(4)} \in \m^3$.
Continuing in the same manner, the last sum will be of arbitrarily high order.
It can be eventually left out because $f$ is finitely determined as an isolated
singularity.
\end{proof}

Since this proof is constructive, we can immediately derive algorithm
\ref{AlgorithmSplittingLemma} from it.

\section{The real classification of the residual part}%
\label{TheRealClassificationOfTheResidualPart}\label{sec:residual_part}

In \cite{AVG1985} Arnold divided the real singularities of modality $0$ and
$1$, using stable equivalence, into main types which split up into more
subtypes by changing the sign in front of certain terms. Each of these subtypes
is complex equivalent to the complex singularity of the same name as its
corresponding real main singularity type. We include the complex
transformations for the corank two singularities in the table below. Since
there is a real main singularity type of modality $0$ or $1$ for each complex
singularity type of modality $0$ or $1$, respectively, there is a bijection
between the main real singularity types of modality $0$ and $1$ and the complex
singularity types of modality $0$ and $1$, respectively. It is not known yet
whether the complex forms of higher modal cases  split up into corresponding
real forms. The fact is that it is not known whether modality is preserved in
these cases. In the next table we list the normal forms that are used in this
article. From here onwards we will be working with stable equivalence. For all
nonquadratic forms $f$ it is thus only necessary, after applying the Splitting
Lemma to consider the residual part of function germs, i.e.\@ germs in $\m^3$.

It is known that the milnor number of a function germ $g$, which we denote by
$\mu(g)$, is the same regardless whether we work over the complex- or real
numbers. Therefore a singularity over the complex numbers is nondegenerate if
and only if the singularity is nondegenerate over the real numbers. The
restrictions to normal forms in the complex case are thus the same in the real
case. Furthermore we know that we can transform the normal forms in the real
case that differ from those we use in the complex case by a complex
transformation to a complex normal form. Since the milnor number is invariant
under complex transformations, we can then determine the restrictions. Let us
take the $X_9$ case as an example and consider the real normal form
$-x^4+ax^2y^2+y^4$. This normal form is complex equivalent to
$x^4+aix^2y^2+y^4$, which corresponds to the given corresponding complex normal
form. Since $a\in\mathbb R$, it follows that $(ia)^2=-a^2\neq4$ and therefore
this singularity is nondegenerate for all values of $a$.

Using the $1-1$ correspondence between the main real singularity types and
complex singularity types, and a \textsc{Singular} library ``classify.lib"
\cite{classify}, that classifies complex singularities, classifying a real germ
boils down to determining to which of the corresponding subtypes the germ is
equivalent.

Throughout the rest of the paper we write $f$ for the given input polynomial,
$g$ for its residual part which can be obtained by applying the Splitting
Lemma~\ref{AlgorithmSplittingLemma}, and $c$ for the corank of $f$.
We also assume that $f$, and thus $g$, is a polynomial over $\mathbb Q$.
With these notations, $g$ is a polynomial in $c$ variables.

\subsection{$\boldsymbol{A_1}$}
If $c = 0$, then it follows  that $f$ is of type
$A_1^+$ or of type $A_1^-$ depending on the inertia index $\lambda$ of $f$. If
the inertia index of $f$ is nonzero and less than the number of variables in
the base ring, then $f$ is both of type $A_1^+$ and $A_1^-$, depending how one
chooses to order the variables. If the inertia index is equal to the number of
variables in the base ring, $f$ is of type $A_1^-$. Lastly, if the inertia
index is $0$, then $f$ is of type $A_1^+$.

\subsection{$\boldsymbol{A_k, k > 1}$}
If $c=1$, then the singularity is of type
$A_k^+$ or of type $A_k^-$ for some $k>1$. Furthermore $g$ is a univariate
polynomial in this case, say $g\in\mathbb Q[x]$. Note that if $k$ is even, then
$A_k^+\requiv A_k^-$. The value of $k$ is given by the order of $g$ minus $1$.
This follows since $\pm x^{k+1}$ and $g$ are right-equivalent and thus have the
same order. The sign of the singularity type is determined by the sign of the
coefficient of $x^{k+1}$. This follows since it follows from
Proposition~\ref{kjet}
that $\jet(g,1)=\pm(\phi_1(x))^{k+1}=\pm(\alpha x)^{k+1}$, where $\phi(\pm
x^{k+1})=g$, $\alpha\in\mathbb R$, and the sign depends on the singularity
type.  Since $k+1$ is even and $\alpha\in\mathbb R$, $\phi$ does not change the
sign of the coefficient of $x^{k+1}$. We use algorithm~\ref{alg:A_k}, after
applying the Splitting Lemma in case $c=0$ or $c=1$.

\begin{algorithm}[h]

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The goal of the rest of the paper is to classify singularities of corank $2$.
In these cases $0\neq g\in\m^3$ is a polynomial in two variables, say
$g\in\mathbb Q[x,y]$. Using the \textsc{Singular} library {\tt classify.lib} we
determine the complex singularity type and thus the main real singularity type
of $g$, or equivalently $f$. The purpose of the remaining algorithms in the
paper is to classify the correct real subtype of $g$, or equivalently $f$. We
now consider each complex type, or equivalently every real main type,
seperately.

\subsection{$\boldsymbol{D_4}$}

The normal form of the complex singularity type $D_4$ is $x^2y+y^3$, which
splits into $x^2y+y^3$ ($D_4^+$) and $x^2y-y^3$ ($D_4^-$) in the real case.
The two cases can be distinguished by blowing-up; the details are carried out
in algorithm~\ref{alg:D_4}. Since the determinacy of
$D_4$ is $3$, it suffices to look at the $3$-jet. If we want to use
$x \mapsto x$, $y \mapsto 1$ as blowing-up map, we first have to make sure that
the coefficient of $x^3$ is non-zero. It is easy to check that this is achieved
by lines 2 to 13 of algorithm~\ref{alg:D_4}. Finally, the number of real roots
after blowing up the 3-jet is an invariant of the real subtype which is 1 in
the case $D_4^+$ and 3 for $D_4^-$.

\ENDIF

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Implementing the algorithms in this paper in \textsc{Singular}, we used the
library \texttt{rootsur.lib} (\cite{roots}) to count the number of real roots
of a univariate polynomial.

\subsection{$\boldsymbol{D_k, k > 4}$}

For the cases $D_k$ with $k > 4$, the complex normal form is $x^2y+y^{k-1}$. It
splits up into $x^2y+y^{k-1}$ ($D_k^+$) and $x^2y-y^{k-1}$ ($D_k^-$) for each
$k$ over the reals. We use the following two results from \cite{Siersma} to
distinguish between the two cases:

\begin{lemma}\label{kDeterminacyD[k]k>4}
A singularity of type $D_k^+$ or $D_k^-$ is $(k-1)$-determined.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{transformationD[k]}
Let $j\ge 4$. Then
\[
x^2y+a_0x^j+a_1x^{j-1}y+\cdots+a_jy^j\requiv x^2y+a_jx^j,
\quad a_0,\ldots,a_j\in\mathbb R,
\]
using the $\mathbb R$-algebra automorphisms
\begin{eqnarray*}
x&\mapsto&x+p_1,\textnormal{ where }
p_1=-\frac{1}{2}(a_1x^{j-2}+\cdots+a_{j-1}y^{j-2})\,,\\
y&\mapsto&y+p_2,\textnormal{ where } p_2=-a_0x^{j-2} \,.
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{lemma}

By Lemma \ref{kDeterminacyD[k]k>4} the determinacy of a singularity of  complex
type
$D_k$ is $k-1$. Therefore we only need to consider the
$(k-1)$-jet of $g$ in this case. Using Proposition~\ref{kjet} and
Lemma~\ref{x^3}, we transform $g$ into a polynomial of the form
\[x^2y+\textnormal{terms of degree higher than $3$}\]
by factorizing the $3$-jet of $g$ as $g_1^2g_2$, $g_1$ and $g_2$ of
degree $1$,
and then applying the automorphism defined by $g_1\mapsto x$, $g_2\mapsto y$ to
$g$. We
now systematically consider the terms of each degree $3<j<k$. By applying the
transformations in Lemma~\ref{transformationD[k]}, for each $j$, the only term
of total degree $j$ which possibly remains is $a_jy^j$. This term vanishes for
$j<k-1$ and it does not vanish for $j=k-1$, otherwise $g$ is not of complex
type $D_k$. Thus, after applying these transformations,
we can write $g$ as $g=x^2y+\alpha y^{k-1}$ with $a\neq0$. Clearly if
$\alpha>0$ then $x^2y+\alpha y^{k-1}\requiv x^2y+y^{k-1}$ and if $\alpha<0$
then $x^2y+\alpha y^{k-1}\requiv x^2y-y^{k-1}$.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{\label{alg:D_k} Algorithm for the case $D_k$, $k > 4$}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\REQUIRE{$g \in \m^3\subset\mathbb Q[x,y]$ of complex singularity type $D_k$,

+a_{j-1}y^{j-2})$, $y\mapsto y-a_0x^{j-2}$ to $h$
\STATE $h:=\jet(h,k-1)$
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\STATE write $h$ as $h=x^2y+\alpha y^{k-1}$, $0\neq\alpha\in\mathbb Q$
\IF{$(\alpha>0)$}
\RETURN $D_k^+$
\ELSE
\RETURN $D_k^-$
\ENDIF

\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{$\boldsymbol{E_6}$}

In this case, whose complex normal form is $x^3+y^4$, we have that either
$g\requiv x^3+y^4$ ($E_6^+$) or $g\requiv x^3-y^4$ ($E_6^-$).
Therefore there exists an $\mathbb
R$-algebra automorphism $\phi$ of $\mathbb R[x,y]$ such that
$\phi(g)=(\phi(x))^3+(\phi(y))^4$ or such that
$\phi(g)=(\phi(x))^3-(\phi(y))^4$.
Since the coefficients of $x^3$ and $y^3$ in $g$ cannot both be zero, we can
ensure that the coefficient of
$x^3$ is non-zero by swapping the variables if necessary. Now, using
Proposition~\ref{kjet} and Lemma~\ref{x^3}, $\jet(g,3)$ factorizes as
$c(g_1)^3$, $c\in\mathbb Q$ and $g_1=b_0x+b_1y\in\mathbb
Q[x,y]$. Again,
using Proposition~\ref{kjet}, it follows that by applying
$x\mapsto\frac{x-b_1y}{b_0},\
y\mapsto y$ to $g$, $\phi$ is transformed such that $\phi_1(x)=c'x$,
$c'\in\mathbb
R$. Since $\phi$ is an automorphism, $\phi_1(y)=d_0x+d_1y$,
$d_0,d_1\in\mathbb R$,
with $d_1\neq 0$. Hence
\begin{equation*}
(\phi(y))^4=d_1^4y^4+\textnormal{terms of degree 4 and higher, not of the
form $\alpha y^4$, $\alpha\in\mathbb R$.}
\end{equation*}
If we can show that $(\phi(x))^3$ does not contain a term of the form
$\alpha y^4$, $\alpha\in\mathbb R$, then we can determine whether $g$
is of type $E_6^-$ or $E_6^+$ by considering the sign of the coefficient of
the monomial $y^4$. Now
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textnormal{jet}((\phi(x))^3,4)-\textnormal{jet}((\phi(x))^3,3)
&=&3(\phi_1(x)^2)(\phi_2(x)-\phi_1(x))\\
&=&3(c'x)^2(\phi_2(x)-\phi_1(x)),
\end{eqnarray*}
 which means that $(\phi(x))^3$ does not have terms of the form $\alpha y^4$,
 $\alpha\in\mathbb R$ .
